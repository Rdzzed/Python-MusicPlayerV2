Hi , I share you here my musical project. It's simple music app player but I need some help to configure my progressbar. The automatic progression is ok but the manual isn't working when I tried to add the fonction in my program. So please if someone can help me to configure the slider.
I added only 2Pac Wonda why they call u B and Picture me rollin but u can download covers and songs in MP3 in internet.
